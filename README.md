## Project Overview
This project is a blog application implemented using a stack of web development technologies including HTML, CSS, Javascript for the frontend,and Express.js with EJS templating for the bacvkend. The blog supports RESTful API architecture and utililizes a method overriding package for enhanced functionality.


## Technologies Used

The following technologies and tools were used in the project:

1. Javascript
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. Express.js
5. EJS(Embedded Javascript) Templating
6. Method Overriding Pckage (npm)


## REST API <a name="rest-api"></a>
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an arcthitectural style for designing networked applications. In our project, we have implemented a RESTful API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on blog posts. Here is an overview of the supported API endpoints:

- `GET /posts`: Retrieve a list of all blog posts.
- `GET /posts/:id`: Retrieve a specific blog post by its ID.
- `POST /posts`: Create a new blog post.
- `PUT /posts/:id`: Update an existing blog post by its ID.
- `DELETE /posts/:id`: Delete a blog post by its ID.

## Features

1. Frontend Development: Designed responsive and user-friendly interfaces using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic behavior.
2. Backend Development: Implemented server-side logic using Express.js, providing robust routing and middleware support.
3. Templating: Leveraged EJS templating to dynamically render HTML content with data from the server.
4. RESTful API: Designed and implemented RESTful API endpoints to enable CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for blog posts.
5. Method Overriding: Incorporated a method overriding package to enhance API functionality and support HTTP methods beyond the basic GET and POST.
